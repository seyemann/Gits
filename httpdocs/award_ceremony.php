                     <br />
                    <p style="margin-top: 5px;">After presenting the certificates, the Mayor of Lambeth toured the facilities
                        with Cllr. Paul McGlone, Elected Member for Ferndale Ward and Cabinet Member
                        for Finance and Resources. As councillors of longstanding, they were pleased
                        to meet with some of the learners, funders and partners working with MIC.</p>
                    <p>The Mayor of Lambeth, Cllr Clive Bennett, said: <blockquote><em>I am delighted to have
                        presented these certificates at MI ComputSolutions&#8217; centre here in
                        Brixton because they demonstrate that efforts to help local people get
                        qualifications are working. It&#8217;s gratifying to meet residents and
                        hear how learning has improved their confidence levels and helped them
                        discover talents they hadn&#8217;t realised they have</em></blockquote></p>
                    <p>One of MIC's learners, Afreen Ashraf, who has completed an employability
                        course and a business administration qualification, said of her experiences:
                        <blockquote><em>I am new to Brixton and since joining MIC in February it has been a great
                        way for me to get to know a lot of people. The staff and teachers made
                        me feel very welcome and I have been given a lot of help and advice every
                        time I needed it. I was so fond of this place that I asked my manager Val
                        to start my work experience at MI Computsolutions and it was great experience.
                        MIC is a great place and I had a wonderful experience achieving the qualifications
                        I need to start my career.</em></blockquote></p>
