					<h3 class="titleSide">What are Apprenticeships?</h3>
					
					<p>An apprenticeship is a great way for individuals to 'earn as they learn' and for employers to discover skilled 
                    and talented employees through a government-backed training scheme which provides a structured learning route 
                    within a working environment. The schemes are focused on motivated people who are determined to succeed within 
                    their workplace.</p>

                <li>
					<a name="benefit"> </a>
					<h3 class="titleSide">Business Benefits</h3>
					
					<p>Apprenticeship help provide ways of bringing in or targeting the skills you need in your organisation. Through a mixture
                     of on the job training and off job learning, apprentices learn the skills that will equip them to do a particular job.</p>
			         <p>The government pays for the training for an apprentice so you have access to funded training for one of your employees. 
                     You can train a new member of staff or recruit someone new onto an apprenticeship. Additionally, the National Apprenticeship Service
                      (NAS) is currently offering apprenticeship grants worth &pound;1,500 to small and medium-sized businesses, employing less than 250 employees, 
                      for recruiting their first apprentice aged 16 to 24 years old.</p>

                <br />
                <li>
					<h3 class="titleSide">Learner Benefits</h3>
					
					<p>Apprentices learn on the job, building up knowledge and job-specific skills, gaining qualifications and earning money while
                     learning or in training. Apprentices work towards work-based qualification such as a National Vocational Qualification (QCF) and other nationally recognised qualifications.</p>
			         <p>There are various types of Apprenticeships available offering over 1,200 job roles. The right one for you will depend on your interests, your experience
                      and the opportunities available within your area.</p>
                      <p>You can also get an <a href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/tickets/27809.aspx" target="_blank">Apprentice Oyster photocard</a> and save 30% against the price of adult rate Travelcards and Bus and Tram Passes</p>

					<a name="eligibility"></a>
					<h3 class="titleSide">Eligibility</h3>
					
					<p>There are no formal minimal requirements for entry to an Apprenticeship, but in order to succeed and get the 
                    most from the programme, a prospective apprentice need to be enthusiastic, committed and hard working.<br />

                    In England, Apprenticeships are designed with individuals aged between 16 and 25 in mind.</p>
